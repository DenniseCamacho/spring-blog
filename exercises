One-to-Many Exercise:
You will create a one-to-many relationship between the Post entity and the PostImage entity. Consider that...
  - “One post may have many images.”
  - “Many images belong to one post.”
1. In the relationship-practice branch of your Spring Blog’s, add an entity of PostImage with the following fields:
  id (typical primary key annotations)
  image_title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
  url VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL - the url is for simple hot linking of images for now
  post_id (a FK that will be created with the proper One-To-Many mapping)
2. Seed your posts table with a blog post about cats
3. Seed your post_images table with three images related to cats (use a hot-linked address for now).

4. Create a simple view that includes displays the title of the cat blog post the three images
5 (BONUS). Add a form to add additional images to the cat blog post.

Many-to-Many Exercise:
You will create a many-to-many relationship between posts and tags. Consider that...
  - “A post may have many tags.”
  - “A tag may be assigned to many posts.”
1. Create a Tag entity class that has the following properties:
  id (typical primary key annotations)
  name VARCHAR(50)
2. Add the proper many-to-many annotations on both entities (Post and Tag) to properly map the relationship. The “join” table should be called “post_tag” and only contain the foreign keys for post_id and tag_id.
3. Seed the tags table with three tags named the following: “Silly”, “Funny”, and “Humor”.
4. Seed the post_tag table with one post that has the “Silly” and “Funny” tags and another having the “Humor” and “Funny” tags. In total, you will need to insert four records.
5. Create a view that will display the titles of posts with the “Funny” tag (you should see the two titles of the posts with the “Funny” tags).
