One-to-Many Exercise:
You will create a one-to-many relationship between the Post entity and the PostImage entity. Consider that...
  - “One post may have many images.”
  - “Many images belong to one post.”
1. In the relationship-practice branch of your Spring Blog’s, add an entity of PostImage with the following fields:
  id (typical primary key annotations)
  image_title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
  url VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL - the url is for simple hot linking of images for now
  post_id (a FK that will be created with the proper One-To-Many mapping)
2. Seed your posts table with a blog post about cats
3. Seed your post_images table with three images related to cats (use a hot-linked address for now).
